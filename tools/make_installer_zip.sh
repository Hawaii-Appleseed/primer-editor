# Build a zip you can hand a colleague: inside is a double-clickable

# opens a Terminal window that runs the one-line installer (the same
# install.sh everyone uses, fetched fresh from GitHub) with the live report
# preset — so the person ends up with the editor, the real Budget Primer,
# and the Dock app, having typed nothing.

#
# The zip is deliberately TINY and never stale: it carries no code of its
# own beyond the bootstrap, because the installer it runs is whatever is on
# main the day it is double-clicked. The one thing the recipient may hit is
# Gatekeeper — the app is unsigned — and README.txt inside says exactly what
# to click when that happens.

Budget Primer Editor — install

1.  Double-click "Install Budget Primer Editor".
2.  If macOS says it can't check the app for malware:
      right-click the app, choose Open, then Open again
    — or on newer macOS: System Settings > Privacy & Security,
      scroll down, click "Open Anyway".
3.  A Terminal window shows the install (a couple of minutes).
    When it finishes the editor opens by itself.

Afterwards the editor lives in ~/Applications as
"Budget Primer Editor" — drag it to the Dock. Opening it always
brings you back to your work, and it keeps itself up to date.

You start with the editor itself: the bundled demo, and
"+ New report" for a blank page of your own — no accounts needed.

To work on a SPECIFIC report later (for example the live Budget
Primer), ask whoever sent you this for the repo name, then either
re-run their install line with PRIMER_LIVE=owner/repo, or clone
the repo and use the editor's start page > "Adopt existing…".

To PUSH edits to a website you also need access to that repo —
File > Connect GitHub inside the editor signs this computer in.
(Saving works without any of that; your edits are never lost.)
