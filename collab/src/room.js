/**
 * One Durable Object per project document.
 *
 * y-partyserver's YServer supplies the Yjs sync protocol, awareness fan-out
 * and the in-memory document; this subclass adds the three things specific to
 * a primer project: durable storage, a seed handshake, and the commit SHA the
 * live document was built from.
 *
 * --- Why the server does not fetch from GitHub --------------------------
 *
 * The Phase 1 scope had the Durable Object bootstrap an empty room by reading
 * content.md and layout.json from the draft branch. It doesn't, and shouldn't:
 *
 *   - It would need a GitHub credential of its own. Every design that gives a
 *     shared server a token that can read (and eventually write) the repo is
 *     strictly worse than one where the credential never leaves the browser
 *     that owns it.
 *   - It would only work for a public repo, or force a service token for a
 *     private one — and primer-editor's consumers include private repos.
 *   - It is redundant. The first client to open the editor has already
 *     fetched both files in order to render the page.
 *
 * So the FIRST client to arrive seeds the room from what it already holds.
 * Exactly one connection is granted the seed (the grant is a synchronous
 * check-and-set below, and a Durable Object is single-threaded, so there is no
 * race); everyone else waits for normal Yjs sync. The room records that it has
 * been seeded in storage, so a later reconnection to an empty-but-seeded room
 * does not re-seed it.

   *   GET  …/files    the document AS FILES: {content, layout, baseSha, …} —
   *                   what the room holds, which is the truth whenever it is
   *                   seeded (the store only ever holds what a room saved)
   *   POST …/files    {content?, layout?, baseSha?, expect?} — write a room
   *                   that NOBODY is in, so a Save made straight to the store
   *                   (the hub's connector, a restore) reaches the copy the
   *                   next person will be handed. Refused while anyone is
   *                   connected (`occupied` — use /pilot, an editor is there
   *                   to apply it) and when `expect.content` is not what the
   *                   room holds (`moved` — the caller read a stale copy)
   *
   * /pilot is how a person's own Claude, talking to the hub's MCP connector,
   * edits a document that someone has open: the ops are relayed to the first
   * editor that may write, which applies them through docsync.api.batch() —
   * one undo step, the same validation as typing — and answers with a
   * `pilot-result`. Nothing is written to the Yjs document from here; the
   * editor that applied the batch syncs it to everyone the ordinary way.
   *
   * Two refusals, told apart because the caller should do different things:
   * `reason:'empty'` — nobody is here, so write the store instead; and
   * `reason:'no-pilot'` — someone IS here but no connection said it can take
   * pilot ops (an editor from before this existed, or a socket whose page is
   * gone). Both fall back to the store, but only the second is worth telling
   * a person about: their colleague should reload.
