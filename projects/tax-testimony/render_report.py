"""Tax testimony one-pager — cross-campaign comparison, letter-size print page.

Every visual is rendered through the engine's hooks so the user can move,
resize and edit it: prose through C.html/C.t (never bare C(), which emits no
data-slot), the chart through graphic() (a bare <svg> is frozen and invisible
to the editor).

The figures are baked in as DATA below rather than read from a file. The 2026
session is closed, so these numbers are final, and a data file the renderer
opens would have to be declared under `editor.engine` in docsync.yml or the
draft silently fails to build in Pyodide. Regenerate from
