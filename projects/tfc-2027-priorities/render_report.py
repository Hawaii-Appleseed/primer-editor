"""Tax Fairness Coalition — 2027 Priorities: What the Poll Said renderer — auto-slotted by `python3 -m docsync.propose`.

body.slotted.html is original.html's body with slot/movable markers; every
marker is substituted at build time from content.md ([[key]] blocks) and
layout.json. Rename a slot by changing the key in BOTH files. Richer wiring
(structured widgets, citations, page-specific edit-mode overrides) still
belongs in this file — see the report-editor skill.
