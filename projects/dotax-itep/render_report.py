"""DOTAX vs ITEP on Act 46 / Act 24 — a one-page methods note.

Every visual goes through the engine's hooks so the user can move, resize and
edit it: prose through C.t/C.html (never bare C(), which emits no data-slot),
each chart through graphic() (a bare <svg> is frozen and invisible to the
editor) wrapped in chart_scroll() (an SVG shrinks with the sheet, so without it
a 12px label is 5px on a phone).

WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS
--------------------
DOTAX and ITEP both scored Hawaii's 2024 income tax cut (Act 46) and the 2026
bill that amended it (SB 3125, enacted May 21 2026 as Act 24, SLH 2026 — the
enrolled text is CD2). Their headline numbers look incompatible: -$1.45B/yr
against -$705M/yr. They are not estimates of the same quantity.

    DOTAX  fiscal year · residents AND nonresidents · incomes grown to the year
           · Act 46 measured against the schedule it replaced
    ITEP   tax year 2031 · residents only · incomes held at 2026 levels
           · Act 46 measured against policy already in force in 2026

Aligning DOTAX to ITEP's frame means DIFFERENCING two fiscal-note lines rather
than reading one, and mapping FY to TY. Both are done below.

THE FY <-> TY MAPPING
---------------------
DOTAX publishes fiscal years; ITEP publishes tax year 2031. Hawaii withholding
splits a tax year's liability across two fiscal years, so the mapping is not
exact. This page uses FY = TY+1 (a TY2031 liability lands mostly in FY2032
collections), which is the convention Census-Forecaster already documents. The
alternative FY = TY is carried in ALT_* below and quoted in the footer note —
it moves every figure but changes no conclusion.

REPRODUCING THE NUMBERS
-----------------------
Everything here is arithmetic on two published tables; there is no model run.
The DOTAX figures are read straight off the presentation. The ITEP component
split is DERIVED (see itep_components below) because ITEP published quintile
rows, not components — the derivation reproduces ITEP's own printed shares to
0.1pp and its printed totals to <1%, which is the check that it is right.

    carry them in from the stat cards and guess which segment they matched.

    slice ITEP's number covers (left, solid) and the slice it doesn't (right,
    pale). The thin orange one beneath is ITEP'S OWN FIGURE, hanging from the

    What this replaces plotted "DOTAX as a share of ITEP" — 28% and 32% against

    made ITEP the denominator without saying why, and left the actual mechanism
    (WHO gets the cut) entirely to prose. Two similar-length bars also did
    nothing to dramatise the one thing that matters, which is that the two
    shortfalls match.

    Now each row is a plain DOTAX-vs-ITEP pair, labelled with real quantities
    in their own units. Filers come first because the filer disagreement CAUSES
    the cost disagreement, so reading top to bottom is the argument: DOTAX
    reaches a third as many people, and prices the cut at a third as much.

    Each row is scaled to its own ITEP bar — unavoidable, since one row is
    people and the other is dollars — which is stated on the chart. That
    normalisation is what puts the two DOTAX bars at visibly the same fraction,
    and that parallel is the finding.
