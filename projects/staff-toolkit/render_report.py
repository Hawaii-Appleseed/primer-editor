"""The Toolkit — the internal guide to the staff hub's tools.

Seven designed sheets on the shared engine, in the Appleseed brand system.
Every heading and paragraph is a content.md slot; the two diagrams go through
graphic(), so they can be moved and resized in the draft editor and their
placement sticks across rebuilds.

Not a research report, so deliberately without the published-report front
matter: no org boilerplate, no copyright page, no author line. The endnotes
point at where each thing is documented rather than at outside sources.

Why the diagrams are code and not assets: a bare <svg> in the markup is frozen
and invisible to the editor (docsync.blocks.graphic), and an uploaded PNG
cannot be recoloured when the palette moves. The cost is that changing what a
diagram SAYS is an edit here, not an edit in the editor.

# ── Figure 1: the three models, and what effort buys ───────────────────────
# Every number here is Anthropic's published measurement, not ours, and the
# two panels are the whole reason the figure exists: effort is a real
# accuracy/cost tradeoff on long coding work and very nearly a no-op on
# research work, so "turn it up" is not general advice.
#
# The accuracy axis runs 0-100 and is NOT truncated. A zoomed axis would make
# 84.0 against 91.7 look like a chasm; the honest picture is two bars of
# similar length beside a cost that quadrupled, and the takeaway line under
# each panel carries the point the bars are too close to shout.
#
# Opus 5's medium row is the one derived figure: the source gives "about 2
# points at medium for half the cost" against a 91.7% / $1.01 default, so it
# is shown as approximate and figmodels.note says where it comes from.
# The use lines say what to REACH FOR each one for, in tasks a reader
# recognises — not what the marketing says. "The best combination of speed and
# intelligence" told nobody when to pick Sonnet. Two lines, and the widths are
# checked against the 200-unit card interior at 5.6 units a character.

# ── Figure 2: GitHub — the repositories, and the public half ────────────────
# One figure per provider, because the combined three-column version made the
# reader hold GitHub and Cloudflare in their head at once to answer either
# question. This one answers "where does the code live and what does Claude
# do with it"; Figure 3 answers "what does Cloudflare keep".
#
# The right-hand column is the whole reason this figure is not just a repo
# list: the Library every staff member reads is built from files one public
# repository serves to anyone. The split is eight public and eight private —
# checked against `gh repo list Hawaii-Appleseed` — so the thing people get
# wrong is not the count but WHICH half holds our own work. The panel header
# carries the count; the rows carry the examples. Hawaii-Appleseed-website is
# row 1 because the arrow to GitHub Pages leaves that row at its centre —
# reorder REPOS and the arrow points at the wrong repository.
#
# ONE story: Claude Code pushes, and the public half feeds the Library. The
# project-directory box that used to hang below the repo panel was a second
# story with a second arrow back out of Claude Code, and the triangle those
# made was this figure's main legibility cost. Sheet 11 addresses the handful
# of people who clone; that detail belongs there, in prose, if anywhere.
#
# Gaps between columns are 26-40 units and carry no labels, so they can be
# tighter than Figure 2's. Manrope bold at 11u runs about 6.5 units a
