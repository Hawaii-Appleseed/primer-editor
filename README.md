# primer-editor

The **docsync draft editor** — a single-file, browser-based WYSIWYG editor that
runs a report's *real* Python renderer in the browser via Pyodide, so what you
edit is exactly what the report will build. This repo is the editor's home:
its source, its engine, its tooling, and its tests all live here.

It ships with the **Hawaiʻi Budget Primer** as its bundled demo and test
fixture — the editor is nothing without a report to render, and the test suite
asserts against that report's real content.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `docsync/editor/edit.html` | the editor itself (the canonical source; one file, no build step) |
| `docs/` | the editor's own shell — `start.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/` — plus, once built, each report's staged copy. **The staged parts are generated and untracked**: `edit.html`, `engine/`, and the built report are written by `make -C report2027 pub`, which the live server also runs on startup. Nothing here is published; the Budget Primer deploys from its own repo. |
| `docsync/*.py` | the **engine**: `content.py` / `layout.py` / `normalise.py` run in Pyodide; `stage.py` / `registry.py` assemble a project's engine beside the editor |
| `report2027/` | the bundled Budget Primer demo — `content.md`, `layout.json`, `tools/render_report.py`, data — that the editor renders and the tests exercise |
| `report2027/tools/serve.py` | the local live server: watch-rebuild-reload, plus `/__save` (commit locally) and `/__push` (send to GitHub) |
| `report2027/tools/make_launcher.sh` | builds a double-clickable macOS `.app` that boots the server and opens the editor |
| `tests/editor/` | the Playwright suite (276 specs) — runs against the real `serve.py` with GitHub fully mocked; never touches the network |

## Install

One line. Requires **Python 3.10+**, **git**, and — only for PDF/PNG export —
**Chrome**.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtomkatsu/primer-editor/main/install.sh | bash
```

That clones the repo to `~/primer-editor`, puts its Python dependencies in a
virtualenv **inside the checkout** (nothing system-wide, no sudo), and builds
`~/Applications/Budget Primer Editor.app`. Delete the directory and the app to
uninstall completely.

`PRIMER_HOME=/some/dir`, `PRIMER_PORT=8011` and `PRIMER_BRANCH=…` override the
defaults.

### The live report too

The editor alone serves its bundled fixture. To ALSO clone the live report
beside it and register it on the start page:

```
PRIMER_LIVE=dtomkatsu/BudgetPrimerFinal \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtomkatsu/primer-editor/main/install.sh)"
```

`PRIMER_LIVE_HOME`, `PRIMER_LIVE_ID` and `PRIMER_LIVE_NAME` override where it
lands and how it is registered. Re-running is safe: an existing clone is left
alone and the registry entry is merged, not clobbered.

### Staying current

Two independent things go stale, so there are two signals, deliberately
different in colour so they never read as one control:

- **The editor** — `tools/selfupdate.py` fast-forwards the checkout each time
  the app opens, and the server re-checks every 20 min (`UPDATE_POLL`). A
  sage `Update (n)` pill appears in the bar naming what is in it.
- **A report living in its own repo** — the server fetches each external
  project root every 5 min (`CONTENT_POLL`) and offers a blue
  `Update report (n)`, tooltipped with the incoming commit subjects.
  `/__pull` fast-forwards and rebuilds.

Both follow the same contract: check in the background, tell the person,
**never apply anything on its own** — a running editor holds unsaved work.
Both refuse rather than merge when the person has uncommitted changes or
unpushed commits, and say which it was. A report inside the editor's own
repo is left to the version chip, so two mechanisms never fast-forward one
checkout.

### Working with no repos at all

A local install is complete in itself: the start page's **“+ New report”**
scaffolds a blank project straight onto disk (no repo, no token, no GitHub —
`docsync/new.py` via the server's `/__scaffold`), and **“Adopt existing…”**
registers any docsync repo already cloned on this computer by its folder
path (`/__adopt`). Inside the editor, **File ▸ Connect GitHub** signs the
computer in with a one-time code (the local server proxies the device flow,
so no relay worker is needed — just the one GitHub App client id via
`PRIMER_GH_CLIENT` or the manifest's `oauth` block), after which Push works
over https with no keychain setup.

## Onboarding a colleague

The zero-typing route — build a zip and send it:

```
./tools/make_installer_zip.sh          # -> dist/Budget-Primer-Editor-Installer.zip
```

Inside is a double-clickable **Install Budget Primer Editor** app (plus a
two-line README covering the unsigned-app Gatekeeper prompt). Opening it runs
the one-line installer above in a visible Terminal window with `PRIMER_LIVE`
preset, then opens the editor. The zip carries no code of its own beyond the
bootstrap, so it never goes stale — what installs is whatever is on `main`
that day.

Two things the installer cannot do for them:

- **Pushing to the website** needs write access to the report's repo — add
  their GitHub account as a collaborator, then have them run `gh auth login`
  once. Saving works without any of this; edits are never lost.
- Their commits sign with whatever git identity the machine has (macOS
  auto-derives one from the username). `git config --global user.name/email`
  makes it a real name.

### It updates itself

The server checks for updates in the background every 20 minutes — not just at
launch — and the editor's version chip (bottom of the toolbar) offers one the
moment it can be taken, naming what's in it. Publishing an update is a
`git push`; nothing here needs a release step.

**It will never lose your work.** What you have installed is a normal git
checkout you own: read it, edit it, commit, open a pull request. Save commits
locally, so an update REBASES your local commits on top of the incoming ones
when the files don't overlap — the common case — and only refuses (naming the
file) when they genuinely touch the same thing. It never fast-forwards over
uncommitted changes. Run `python3 tools/selfupdate.py --check` any time to see
where you stand.

**One bad update, undone in one click.** Every update records the version you
were on before it ran; the version chip's tooltip offers "go back" whenever
there's somewhere to go back to. `python3 tools/selfupdate.py --rollback` does
the same from a terminal.

### Or by hand

```
git clone https://github.com/dtomkatsu/primer-editor && cd primer-editor
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make -C report2027 live          # http://localhost:8010/primer/edit.html
```

`make live` runs `tools/preflight.py` first: it checks the Python version and
PyYAML, arms the vendoring git hook, and tells you if Chrome is missing. It is
idempotent — it runs on every start and only reports what needs attention.

Nothing else is required. There is no build step, no bundler, and no account:
the editor is one HTML file and the renderer is your report's own Python,
running in the browser via Pyodide.

Optional, macOS only — a double-clickable launcher:

```
./report2027/tools/make_launcher.sh   # -> ~/Applications/Budget Primer Editor.app
```

### Two files that are yours, not the repo's

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `docs/primer/projects.json` | which reports your start page lists, and where their files live on **this** machine. Untracked — copy `projects.example.json` if you want to customise it. Without it, every report in `docsync.yml` is still served. |
| `vendor.local.yml` | other repos on this machine that vendor this engine, synced by the post-commit hook. Untracked; `vendor.yml` ships empty so a clone never writes into a checkout it does not have. |

Where a report's **Save/Push** goes is recorded per project in its staged
`engine/manifest.json`. It defaults to your own checkout's `origin`, and the
editor asks the first time if there is none.

`make live` starts `serve.py`: it rebuilds the report on any change and reloads
the browser, so an edit shows in ~1s. **Save** writes the files and commits
*locally only*; **Push** is a separate, explicit trip to GitHub.

## Test it

```
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium   # the browser itself — npm ci does not fetch it
npx playwright test               # the full editor suite (276 specs)
python3 docsync/test_docsync.py       # the engine's own self-test
python3 report2027/tools/test_render.py   # render tolerances + edit.html syntax
```

The suite starts its own throwaway `serve.py` on port 8199 and mocks GitHub
entirely — it never touches the network or your real repo. It also regenerates
`docs/` on startup, so it works on a clone that has never been built.

## The editor

Canva-style: a left rail (Text/Shape/Icon/Table/Chart) opens a docked panel
rather than a cramped popover; a contextual toolbar appears above the canvas
for whatever is selected; a bottom strip shows every page as a thumbnail and
can be collapsed when you don't need it (remembered per project). The
top-left **File** menu is where report-level actions live: Open (switch
between reports this server knows about), Resize (six standard doc sizes —
changing one re-renders the report at it, live), Google Doc, Download, and the
GitHub token.

**Google Doc** records which doc a report was drafted in, and **Import text
from the Doc** brings that text in: the server reads the doc and proposes where
each section lands — by its `[[key]]` markers if it has them, otherwise by
matching its headings to what the slots currently say — and you approve the
list row by row before anything is written. It is one-way; the doc is never
written to, and the whole import is a single undo. Clicking the report itself dismisses whatever menu or panel is open,
except the ones that describe your current selection (Table/Chart/Colour),
which stay open so you can keep working while they're up.

## Architecture: one editor, many reports

The editor knows nothing about any particular report. Everything specific — the
renderer, what it reads, the page size, the palette — comes from
`engine/manifest.json`, staged beside the editor from `docsync.yml` by
`python3 -m docsync.stage`. A second report is a second registry entry, not a
second editor. The editor's landing page (`start.html`) can **connect** a new
repo or **adopt** an existing project, and each project records its own repo and
deploy branch.

### The shared engine

`docsync/` (the `content.py` / `layout.py` renderer) is a shared dependency: the
editor runs it in Pyodide, **and** a report repo's own build (`render_report.py`
→ `make pub`) imports it. This repo owns it. A report repo (e.g.
`BudgetPrimerFinal`) **vendors a synced copy** — the editor already stages a copy
of the engine into every project it serves, so the pattern is native. A report
repo keeps its own `serve.py` + vendored editor for the sub-second local
fast-loop; it refreshes them from here with a small sync script when it wants
the latest editor.

So: **editor development happens here**; reports pull updates when they choose,
and their fast local loop never depends on a network.

### On the staff hub

Staff who have no GitHub account use the editor on the internal hub
(`staff-updates-internal/primer/`), behind the Google sign-in they already
have. `python3 -m docsync.hub` vendors the editor and every project's engine
there, and the post-commit hook keeps that copy current — see
[collab/README.md](collab/README.md), "Served from the staff hub".
