// A version bump must only cost a re-render when something actually MOVED.
//
// Every rebuild restages the whole engine, and any watched file anywhere in the
// repo bumps the version for every project. _pull() used to answer all of that
// by rewriting the engine into Pyodide's FS and re-rendering unconditionally —
// about a second of frozen main thread, per bump, usually for byte-identical
// bytes. The status row said "reloaded", which was exactly the branch where
// nothing had changed; scrolling through one reads as a stutter.
//
// Both halves are asserted in one test on purpose. A no-op bump proves itself
// by ABSENCE (the status row stays untouched), which would also "pass" if the
// bump never arrived at all — so the same test goes on to send a bump that DOES
// change an engine file and requires the render, proving the plumbing under the
// negative assertion was live the whole time.
