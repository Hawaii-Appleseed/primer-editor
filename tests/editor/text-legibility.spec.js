// Text a reader can actually read, measured where the reader is.
//
// The recurring failure this pins: type that is fine on the screen it was
// designed on and unreadable everywhere else. One page has three sizes and
// only one of them gets looked at during design —
//
//   * desktop screen: primer.css puts `zoom: 1.25` on `.page` above 1120px,
//     so every review of a wide window sees 125% of what anyone else does;
//   * print / PDF: no zoom, 1in = 96px, so a 13.5px paragraph is 10.1pt;
//   * phone or Squarespace embed: `.page{max-width:100%}` shrinks an 8.5in
//     sheet to 375px — 0.42x. HTML text does NOT shrink with it (a px is a
//     px), but every SVG with a viewBox does, so chart labels alone collapse.
//     That asymmetry is why charts are the thing that keeps going wrong. The
//     phone case passes because blocks.py's chart_scroll() stops each chart
//     shrinking at the width where its smallest label reaches the floor and
//     scrolls the wrapper instead — NOT because SVG text is naturally safe
//     here. A chart added without that wrapper fails this test at 375px.
//
// docsync/check.py catches what can be read out of the markup: an inch-sized
// chart label, an inline font-size. It cannot resolve a CLASS to a size, and
// it cannot know the 0.42x. This spec measures what the browser computed, on
// real page content, at the widths people actually read at — which is the
// only place the scaled and the cascaded cases are visible at all.
//
// Floors live in docsync/layout.py (MIN_TEXT_PT and friends) so the renderer's
// clamps, docsync.check and this spec can never disagree about the line.
